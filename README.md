<h1>🌸 Welcome you all on the official github of <b>HUGFUGEE<b></h1>

<p>In the hackathon "Hack for the future" we have made it our mission to develop an app that supports the people who need our help the most.</p>
<br>
<p>We, who work together on this app with a lot of joy, commitment and team spirit, come from Germany, Greece, Spain and Turkey. And what all countries unfortunately have in common is that the many people who are new to our countries are often completely on their own.</p>
<br>
<p>This is where our app comes in. She offers a Liveboddy for anyone looking for help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>instant</li>
<li>useable without being literated</li>
<li>discreet</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>To have the best user experience, make sure you use the app in <b>mobile view<b>.</p>
<br>
<p>We hope you enjoy using this app 🍀</p>
<br>
<p>Let's make this world a better world - <b>together</b>🕊</p>
